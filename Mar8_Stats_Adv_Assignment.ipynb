    "A probability density function (PDF) is a mathematical function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a given value. It is often used to model the distribution of continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF is a non-negative function that integrates to 1 over the range of possible values of the variable. It is typically denoted by f(x), where x is the random variable. The PDF can be used to calculate the probability that the variable falls within a particular range of values by integrating the PDF over that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF can also be used to calculate other descriptive statistics of the distribution, such as the mean and variance. For example, the mean of a distribution with PDF f(x) can be calculated as the integral of xf(x) over the range of possible values of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common examples of probability density functions include the normal distribution, which is often used to model continuous data in many fields, and the exponential distribution, which is often used to model waiting times and lifetimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a probability density function is a mathematical function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a given value. It is an important concept in probability theory and statistics, and is often used to model the distribution of continuous data."

    "There are many types of probability distributions in statistics, but some of the most commonly used distributions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Normal distribution: Also known as the Gaussian distribution, it is a continuous probability distribution that is symmetric and bell-shaped. It is often used to model continuous variables that have a roughly symmetrical distribution, such as heights, weights, and IQ scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2.Binomial distribution: It is a discrete probability distribution that models the probability of a certain number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials. It is often used in situations where there are only two possible outcomes, such as flipping a coin or conducting a survey.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3.Poisson distribution: It is a discrete probability distribution that models the probability of a certain number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space. It is often used to model rare events, such as accidents, natural disasters, or defects in a manufacturing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Exponential distribution: It is a continuous probability distribution that models the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur randomly and independently over time. It is often used to model waiting times, such as the time between calls to a customer service center.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5.Uniform distribution: It is a continuous probability distribution that models a situation where all values within a certain range are equally likely to occur. It is often used to model situations where there is no a priori reason to believe that any particular value is more likely than any other, such as rolling a fair die.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6.Gamma distribution: It is a continuous probability distribution that generalizes the exponential distribution to allow for a wider range of shapes. It is often used to model waiting times or lifetimes that follow a more complex pattern than the simple exponential distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of the many probability distributions that are used in statistics, each with its own characteristics and applications."

We then plot a histogram of the sample using Matplotlib's hist() function. The bins argument specifies the range of values to include in each bin of the histogram, and we set it to range(n+2) to ensure that all possible values from 0 to 10 are included. The rwidth argument sets the width of each bar in the histogram, and the align argument specifies the alignment of the bars with respect to the bin edges. Finally, we add axis labels and a title to the plot and display it using the show() function."

    "    2.Each trial is independent.\n",
    "    3.The probability of success is constant for each trial.\n",

    "In summary, the main difference between the binomial and Poisson distributions is that the binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of trials, while the Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a certain average rate of occurrence. The binomial distribution assumes that the trials are independent and have a constant probability of success, while the Poisson distribution assumes that the events occur randomly and independently of each other, with a constant rate of occurrence."
