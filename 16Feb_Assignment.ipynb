    "    SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns. They use SQL to query and manipulate the data. SQL databases are great for applications that require transactions, such as banking, e-commerce, and accounting systems, where data consistency is critical. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "NoSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "    NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in various ways, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, graph, or column-family data stores. NoSQL databases are highly scalable and flexible, making them ideal for applications that handle big data or require high availability, such as social media, gaming, and IoT (Internet of Things) systems. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
