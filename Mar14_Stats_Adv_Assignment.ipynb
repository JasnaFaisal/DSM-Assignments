    "To conduct an F-test to determine if two population variances are significantly different, we need to compare the sample variances using the F-statistic and then compare it to the critical F-value at the desired significance level. Here's the step-by-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Define the null and alternative hypotheses. The null hypothesis is that the variances of the two populations are equal, while the alternative hypothesis is that they are not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    H0: σ1^2 = σ2^2\n",
    "    Ha: σ1^2 ≠ σ2^2\n",
    "Step 2: Set the significance level α. In this case, α = 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Calculate the sample variances for each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    n1 = 6, x1 = [80, 85, 90, 92, 87, 83]\n",
    "    s1^2 = 26.6667\n",
    "\n",
    "    n2 = 6, x2 = [75, 78, 82, 79, 81, 84]\n",
    "    s2^2 = 9.2\n",
    "where n is the sample size, x is the sample data, and s^2 is the sample variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Calculate the F-statistic:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    F = s1^2 / s2^2\n",
    "    F = 26.6667 / 9.2\n",
    "    F = 2.8978\n",
    "Step 5: Find the critical F-value at α/2 and degrees of freedom (df1, df2). The degrees of freedom for the numerator and denominator are given by (n1 - 1) and (n2 - 1), respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    df1 = n1 - 1 = 5\n",
    "    df2 = n2 - 1 = 5\n",
    "    F_crit = F.ppf(α/2, df1, df2)\n",
    "    F_crit = F.ppf(0.005, 5, 5)\n",
    "    F_crit = 5.987\n",
    "where F.ppf is the percent point function (inverse of the cumulative distribution function) of the F-distribution in the scipy.stats module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6: Compare the F-statistic to the critical F-value. If the F-statistic is greater than the critical F-value, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    F < F_crit\n",
    "    2.8978 < 5.987\n",
    "Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis at the 1% significance level. We do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the variances of the two populations are significantly different"
