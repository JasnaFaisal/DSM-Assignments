    "Both Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are techniques used for encoding categorical variables into numerical values to be used as inputs to machine learning algorithms. However, they differ in the way they assign numerical values to the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category based on the order of their importance or hierarchy. For instance, if we have a variable \"size\" with categories ['small', 'medium', 'large'], then we can encode them as [1, 2, 3] or [0, 1, 2], depending on the implementation. Here, the order of the values matters, and we assume that the magnitude of the integer values represents the magnitude of the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding, on the other hand, assigns a unique integer value to each category without considering any order or hierarchy. For instance, if we have a variable \"color\" with categories ['red', 'green', 'blue'], then we can encode them as [0, 1, 2] or [1, 2, 3], depending on the implementation. Here, the order of the values does not matter, and we assume that the integer values represent unique labels for each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between these two techniques depends on the specific requirements of the problem at hand. In general, we prefer to use Ordinal Encoding when there is a natural order or hierarchy among the categories. For example, in the case of the variable \"size,\" there is a natural order, and small is considered less than medium, and medium is considered less than large. On the other hand, we prefer to use Label Encoding when there is no natural order or hierarchy among the categories, such as in the case of the variable \"color.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that Ordinal Encoding may not be suitable for some machine learning algorithms that assume that the numerical values have a linear relationship with the outcome. In such cases, Label Encoding may be a better choice.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used for encoding categorical variables based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. The idea is to assign a numerical value to each category that is related to the target variable's outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the general steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each category of the categorical variable, calculate the mean or median value of the target variable. For instance, if we have a categorical variable \"city\" with categories ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago'], we can calculate the mean or median value of the target variable (e.g., house price) for each city.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort the categories based on their mean or median value of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assign a numerical value to each category based on their sorted position. For instance, if we sort the cities based on the mean house price, we can assign the values [3, 1, 2] to the categories ['New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago'], respectively. Here, the value of 3 represents the highest mean house price, and the value of 1 represents the lowest mean house price.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is that it can capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, which can improve the predictive power of the machine learning model. For example, in a real estate price prediction model, we can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to encode the variable \"neighborhood\" based on the median house price for each neighborhood. This can help the model capture the relationship between the neighborhood and the house price more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind when using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is that it may introduce some information leakage between the training and test data sets. This is because we are using the target variable's information to encode the categorical variable, which can lead to overfitting. To avoid this, we should calculate the mean or median value of the target variable only on the training data set and use the same encoding scheme for the test data set."

Specifically, covariance measures the extent to which the two variables move together, either positively or negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it helps to identify whether there is a relationship between two variables and the nature of that relationship. It can be used to determine whether the variables are positively related, negatively related, or not related at all. In addition, covariance is often used in other statistical calculations, such as correlation coefficients, regression analysis, and factor analysis.\n",

Conversely, if the covariance is negative, it indicates a negative relationship between the two variables, meaning that as one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease. If the covariance is zero, it indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables.\n",
