    "   #### 1.Descriptive Statistics: \n",
    "    Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and describe the basic features of a dataset. They provide a simple and efficient way to summarize large amounts of data, and they include measures of central tendency (such as mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (such as standard deviation and range), and measures of shape (such as skewness and kurtosis). Descriptive statistics are used to describe the characteristics of a sample or a population, and they are often used in fields such as economics, psychology, and public health. For example, a researcher might use descriptive statistics to summarize the age distribution of a sample of patients in a medical study.\n",
    "\n",
    "  #### 2.Inferential Statistics: \n",
    "    Inferential statistics are used to make inferences and predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data. They involve the use of probability theory and statistical inference techniques to draw conclusions from data. Inferential statistics are often used in hypothesis testing and regression analysis, and they are important in scientific research and decision-making. For example, a researcher might use inferential statistics to test whether a new drug is more effective than an existing treatment, or whether a particular policy intervention has had a significant impact on a population.\n",

    "It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because different statistical methods and analyses are appropriate for different levels of measurement. Using an inappropriate statistical method can lead to incorrect conclusions and interpretations. For example, using a mean to summarize ordinal data would be incorrect since the mean is based on the assumption of interval-level data, which ordinal data does not meet. Similarly, using a correlation analysis to measure the relationship between nominal data variables would also be incorrect since nominal data does not have an inherent order and cannot be correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example to illustrate this point is a study that aims to investigate the relationship between gender and job satisfaction. In this case, gender is nominal data since it represents categories without any inherent order. To analyze this data, the appropriate statistical analysis would be a chi-square test or a contingency table analysis to determine if there is a significant association between gender and job satisfaction. If the data were ordinal, the appropriate statistical analysis would be a non-parametric correlation analysis, such as a Spearman's rank correlation. If the data were ratio, the appropriate statistical analysis would be a linear regression analysis.\n",

    "Descriptive statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with summarizing and describing data sets. It includes methods of organizing, summarizing, and presenting data in a clear and meaningful way. Descriptive statistics aims to provide a summary of the data that is being analyzed, without making any inferences or predictions about the population from which the data was drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we collect data on the height of students in a class, we can use descriptive statistics to calculate the mean, median, and mode of the heights, as well as the standard deviation and range of the heights. These statistics would provide a summary of the height distribution of the students in the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that deals with making inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics involves using sample data to draw conclusions about a larger population. It allows us to make inferences about the population based on the characteristics of the sample.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Mean:\n",
    "The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values in the dataset. It is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. The mean provides an average value that represents the entire dataset, and is sensitive to extreme values or outliers.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Variance: \n",
    "The variance is the average of the squared differences of each value from the mean. It measures the spread of the data around the mean, and provides a more robust measure of variability than the range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standard deviation:\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of the spread of the data around the mean, and is widely used in statistical analysis as a measure of variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures of central tendency and variability can be used to provide a summary of the dataset, helping to identify patterns or trends in the data. For example, a high mean and a high standard deviation suggest a dataset with a wide spread of values and possible outliers, while a low mean and low standard deviation suggest a dataset with values that are closely clustered around the mean. Understanding these measures of central tendency and variability can help in making accurate statistical inferences and drawing valid conclusions from data."
