    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the estimation of population parameters based on sample data. The population parameter is an unknown characteristic of a population, such as the population mean or variance, and the sample data is a subset of observations drawn from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Point estimate:\n",
    "A point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the unknown population parameter. It is computed from the sample data and is used as an estimate of the corresponding population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean, and the sample variance is a point estimate of the population variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval estimate:\n",
    "An interval estimate is a range of values that is likely to contain the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence. This range is computed from the sample data and is called a confidence interval. The confidence interval is expressed as an interval of values and a confidence level, such as 95% or 99%. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean indicates that we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies within this interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, point estimate provides a single value estimate of the population parameter, while interval estimate provides a range of values likely to contain the population parameter with a certain level of confidence."

    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether a hypothesis about a population parameter is supported by the sample data. It involves making an assumption, called the null hypothesis (H0), and testing whether the sample data provides enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis (Ha).\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis typically represents the status quo or the default assumption, while the alternative hypothesis represents the claim or the hypothesis being tested. The process of hypothesis testing involves calculating a test statistic, which measures the difference between the sample data and the null hypothesis, and comparing it to a critical value or a p-value. If the test statistic is greater than the critical value or the p-value is less than the significance level (usually 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "Hypothesis testing is used to make decisions based on sample data and to draw conclusions about a population based on the sample data. It is used in a wide range of fields, including science, engineering, medicine, business, and social sciences, to test hypotheses and to make decisions based on data.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1.State the null and alternative hypotheses: \n",
    "The first step in hypothesis testing is to state the null and alternative hypotheses based on the research question or claim being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Set the significance level: \n",
    "The significance level (alpha) is the probability of making a type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. It is typically set to 0.05 or 0.01.\n",

    "#### 3.Choose the appropriate statistical test:\n",
    "The choice of statistical test depends on the type of data, the sample size, and the assumptions about the population distribution. Common statistical tests include t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, and regression analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.Collect and analyze the data:\n",
    "Once the appropriate statistical test has been chosen, the next step is to collect and analyze the data. The sample data is used to calculate a test statistic, which is compared to a critical value or p-value to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.Calculate the test statistic: \n",
    "The test statistic is a measure of how far the sample data deviates from the null hypothesis. The test statistic is calculated using the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and other parameters of the population being tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.Determine the critical value or p-value: \n",
    "The critical value or p-value is the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value or if the p-value is less than alpha, the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7.Interpret the results: \n",
    "The final step in hypothesis testing is to interpret the results and draw conclusions based on the statistical analysis. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it means there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "The p-value is used to determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected or not. If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (usually set at 0.05 or 0.01), the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis. This means that there is strong evidence that the alternative hypothesis is true, and that the observed difference or effect is not due to chance.\n",

    "The p-value is an important concept in hypothesis testing because it provides a way to quantify the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, while a larger p-value indicates weaker evidence. Additionally, the p-value allows for a more objective and standardized way of interpreting the results of hypothesis tests, as it provides a clear threshold for rejecting or not rejecting the null hypothesis based on the level of significance chosen.\n",

    "Student's t-distribution, also known as the t-distribution, is a probability distribution that is used in statistics to model the distribution of t-statistics. The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution, but is characterized by heavier tails, which means it has more probability in the tails than the normal distribution. The t-distribution is a family of distributions that are parameterized by the degrees of freedom, which determine the shape of the distribution.\n",

    "The t-distribution is used in hypothesis testing when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown. In these cases, the t-distribution provides a more accurate estimate of the population mean than the normal distribution. The t-distribution is also used in confidence interval estimation for small sample sizes.\n",

    "The t-distribution is particularly useful when dealing with small sample sizes because it provides a way to estimate the population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown. The t-distribution is also used when the population is normally distributed, but the sample size is too small to use the normal distribution. In these cases, the t-distribution can be used to perform hypothesis testing or construct confidence intervals.\n",
