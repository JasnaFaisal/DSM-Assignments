    "Bokeh server is a Python library that enables the creation of interactive web-based visualizations that can be updated in real time. With Bokeh server, data scientists and developers can create dynamic dashboards, real-time data monitoring applications, and other interactive data visualizations that can be served directly from a Python server.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an interactive plot with Bokeh server, you need to define a Bokeh server application. The application can be created using the Bokeh curdoc() function, which returns a document that can be used to add Bokeh objects such as plots, widgets, and layouts. You can define the behavior of the objects in the document using Python code, which will be executed on the server whenever the user interacts with the visualization.\n",

    "Overall, Bokeh server provides a powerful tool for creating interactive data visualizations that can be easily deployed and shared with others. By combining the power of Python with the flexibility of web-based visualization, Bokeh server makes it possible to create dynamic, real-time applications that can help users explore and understand complex data sets."
