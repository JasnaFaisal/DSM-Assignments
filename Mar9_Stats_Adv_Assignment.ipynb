    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two important concepts in probability theory and statistics. They are used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",

    "A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes on a specific value. In other words, it provides the probability that a certain event will occur. The PMF is defined for discrete random variables, which take on a countable number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a six-sided die. The PMF for this die would be a function that assigns probabilities to each possible outcome, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the die is fair, each outcome has an equal probability of occurring, so the PMF would look like this:\n",

    "The PMF shows that each possible outcome has a probability of 1/6 of occurring. If we wanted to find the probability of rolling a 3, for example, we could use the PMF and see that PMF(3) = 1/6, which means the probability of rolling a 3 is 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. Unlike the PMF, which is defined for discrete variables, the PDF is defined for continuous random variables, which can take on an infinite number of possible values within a range.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a random variable X that represents the height of adult humans. The PDF for X might look something like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "P(65 <= X < 66) = ∫65^66 PDF(x) dx = 0.036\n",

The importance of the normal distribution lies in the fact that it provides a mathematical framework to describe the likelihood of events occurring, which can help in making better decisions and predictions. Some of the key reasons why normal distribution is important are:\n",

    "1.Central Limit Theorem: Normal distribution is a key component of the central limit theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample mean of a random variable will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the underlying distribution of the variable. This theorem is essential in inferential statistics, as it enables us to make inferences about a population based on a sample.\n",

Normal distribution also provides a basis for predicting the probability of an event occurring, which is essential in many real-world applications.\n",

    "3.Efficient Parameter Estimation: Normal distribution is a convenient distribution for parameter estimation because it is easy to estimate the mean and standard deviation from data. The normal distribution is also the maximum entropy distribution for a given mean and standard deviation, which makes it the most probable distribution under certain conditions.\n",
