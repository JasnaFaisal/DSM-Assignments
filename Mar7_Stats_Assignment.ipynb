    "#### Range:\n",
    "The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. It gives an indication of how spread out the data is. A large range means that the data is spread out over a wide range of values, while a small range means that the data is more tightly clustered around the central tendency. For example, if we have the following dataset of test scores: [55, 60, 65, 70, 75], the range is 20 (75 - 55). This indicates that the test scores are spread out over a wide range of values.\n",

For example, if we have the following dataset of test scores: [55, 60, 65, 70, 75], the variance is approximately 62.5. This indicates that the test scores are somewhat spread out.\n",

For example, if we have the following dataset of test scores: [55, 60, 65, 70, 75], the standard deviation is approximately 7.9. This indicates that the test scores are somewhat spread out.\n",
